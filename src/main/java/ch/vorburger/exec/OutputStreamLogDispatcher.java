 * Dispatcher of STDOUT vs STDIN output to slf4j logger levels.

 * of sending STDOUT to INFO and STDERR to ERROR.  In particular,
 * this can be used to tune "noisy" processes which output too
 * much stuff to STDERR which isn't really meant for an error
 * log in a Java application, by filtering based on actual
 * output line content (useful e.g. if the process uses it's
 * own text to distinguish log levels in it's output).
