/**
 * Dispatcher of STDOUT vs STDIN output to slf4j logger levels.
 *
 * <p>This allows to customize a ManagedProcess' default behavior
 * of sending STDOUT to INFO and STDERR to ERROR. In particular,
 * this can be used to tune "noisy" processes which output too
 * much stuff to STDERR which isn't really meant for an error
 * log in a Java application, by filtering based on actual
 * output line content (useful e.g. if the process uses it's
 * own text to distinguish log levels in it's output).
 *
 * <p>It also allows to suppress logging (some) STDOUT and/or
 * STDERR all together, by permitting to return <code>null</code>.
 * This is useful e.g. for processes which emit some lines you
 * might never want to see in any log at all, e.g. for security.
